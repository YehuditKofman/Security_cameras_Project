# Smart Security Cameras Project

A full-stack final project for security footage analysis. This system allows uploading surveillance videos, processes them using advanced computer vision models in Python, and presents an interactive visualization of the number of people detected over time in a responsive React dashboard. The system includes authentication, user roles, MongoDB integration, and video processing using YOLOv8.

---

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main folders:

```
project-root/
├── react/     # Frontend - React application for UI and user management
├── nodejs/    # Backend - Express.js server handling auth, file upload, DB
├── python/    # Video processing service using YOLOv8 and Flask
```


---

## Main Features

- Upload surveillance video files through the React interface.
- Authenticate users using JWT with email verification via Nodemailer.
- Manage users, roles, permissions, and video access.
- Use YOLOv8 model (via Ultralytics) to detect people in each video segment.
- Process video in intervals and return average people count per segment.
- Visualize results as interactive graphs using Recharts in React.
- Communicate between backend (Node.js) and video analysis service (Python) via HTTP POST.
- Store video metadata and users in MongoDB.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YehuditKofman/Security_cameras_Project.git
cd security-cameras-project
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required libraries:
- flask
- flask-cors
- opencv-python
- numpy
- tqdm
- ultralytics

### 3. Install Node.js Server

```bash
cd ../nodejs
npm install
```

### 4. Install React Frontend

```bash
cd ../react
npm install
```

---

## Running the Project

### Step 1: Start Python Server

```bash
cd python
python app.py
```

Make sure YOLOv8 model `yolov8n.pt` is available in the working directory.

### Step 2: Start Node.js Server

```bash
cd ../nodejs
npm start
```

This server handles:
- JWT auth
- MongoDB operations
- Uploading video files to `uploads/`
- Forwarding requests to the Python server

### Step 3: Start React App

```bash
cd ../react
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the app.

## Flow Description

1. A user logs in to the system using a verified email.
2. The user uploads a video file via the React interface.
3. The Node.js server saves the video locally and forwards its name to the Python service.
4. The Python service processes the video using YOLOv8, detects people in each interval, and returns a summary as JSON.
5. The React app receives the data and renders a graph per video, showing the number of people per minute.



---

## Example Output

```json
[
  { "hour": "00:00", "people": 2 },
  { "hour": "00:01", "people": 3 },
]
```
